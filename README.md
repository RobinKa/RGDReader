# RGD Reader
**This project was a proof of concept and is now being superseded by [AOEMods.Essence](https://github.com/aoemods/AOEMods.Essence) which should be used instead.**

This project provides a library, a command line interface too and a graphical user interface for reading Age of Empire 4 Relic Chunky archives such as `.rgd` and `.rrtex`.

Made with C# and .NET 6. The GUI is made with WPF.

The project is mostly in a proof of concept stage right now. It can read all RGD files of AOE4 that I tried. However there are no tests yet and the code is messy.
